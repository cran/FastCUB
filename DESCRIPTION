Description: For ordinal rating data, consider the accelerated EM algorithm to estimate and test models within the family of
    CUB models (where CUB stands for Combination of a 
	discrete Uniform and a shifted Binomial distributions). The procedure is built upon Louis' identity for the observed information matrix. Best-subset variable selection is then implemented since it becomes more feasible from the computational point of view.
